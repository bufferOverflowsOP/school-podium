Open list.html. This contains the code for you to copy paste into your version of list.html.<br /><br />
Copy and paste that one in, then make any edits you wish to make. For example, to change the rankings, simply <strong> open the file with a text editor</strong>, and use the text editor to change the rankings by hand. <br /><br />
After your first time copying from this file, there is no need for you to download the link from here anymore (unless I make any adjustments to the website, following a notice from you). Just use your text editor to edit the appropriate rankings.
